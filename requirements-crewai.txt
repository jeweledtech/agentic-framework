# CrewAI Orchestration Dependencies (optional)
#
# Install these to enable CrewAI-based crew orchestration:
#   pip install -r requirements-crewai.txt
#
# Without these, the framework uses direct LLM calls for all agent tasks.
# CrewAI adds multi-agent workflow orchestration with process management.
